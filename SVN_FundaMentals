Technically "tag" & "branch" Both Are Same In The Context Of Subersive is a Copy Of The Codebase As It Appears At Given Time.

"tag" are Looked Upon More Of As a Constant Snapshot Of a Project And They Do Not Change Overtime And Can Be Used To Main The Released Stable Code. Can Also Be Used As a Check Point.

"branches" Are Mostly Used For Different Aspect Of Project(release management) and Later Merged To trunk.

"trunk" Should Always Be Kept As Stable As Possible, This Is The Place For Developers To Workon.

"merge" Basically Is A Way To Pull Changes From branch Back to trunk.

branch - Once Development is Done, Release Has To Happen . In That Situation New Branch will  Created For That Release.And Once The 
         Release Is Done, The Branch Loses Its Existence, As Equivalent To It Does Not Exists.

tag    - Once The Release Is Done. The Released Version Of Code Will Be Pushed Into a label Called tag.
	       For Any Maintainance Or HotFix Delivery , a New Branch Needs To Be Created From tag. Because tag Contains The Latest Released 	
         Stable Code.
