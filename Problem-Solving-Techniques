There Are Two Aspects Of Problem Solving , They Are -
	1. Programming Methodology
	2. Data Structures

These 2 Terms Are Quite Integrated With Each Other And They Go Hand to Hand In Solving Any Problem 
For Which A Computer Program Is Required To Be Developed.

Given a Problem And We have To Solve The Problem Efficiently. 
The Issue At Hand In Most Of The Task Of The Computer Science Is  The Issue Of Problem Solving.

Unless We Understand How To Solve a Problem In a Computer Quite Efficiently And What Are The Steps
To Do It, It Will Be Difficult For Us To Understand , What Programming Methodology & Data Structuring 
Means Because These Are Two Derived Items Of The System Of Problem Solving.

We Need To Remember That We Are Solving The Problem In A Particular Computer, And This Computer Has 
Got Some Structure And Architecture.

On The Other Hand Problem Solving Is Not A Merely A Process Of Programming.

It Is The Process Of Developing The Solution For The Problem Which Is Expressed In a Natural Form.
For Example If Somebody Gives a Problem To Find Maximum Of n Numbers. Here The Problem Is Posed In 
Natural Language.

It Is Our Responsibility To Convert  This Problem Posed In Natural Language To a Computer Understandable Language 
Which Will Solve The Problem.

If We Had Technology  Which Could Understand The Natural Language Itself ,Then We Would Not Require This 
Series Of Tasks Of Programming Or The Concept Of Programming Methodology And Data Structures Would Have Been Automated
Already.

So Since We Are Having Programming Language / Computer Which Can Understand A Restricted Form Of Language
And The Problem Is Posed In a Natural Language. It Is Our Task To Convert This Problem Into The Language 
Of The Computer So That It Works Efficiently. So This Is The Core Concept Of Problem Solving.

Our Task Is To Understand the Technique Of Problem Solving.

----=======

- The Very First Aspect Of Problem Solving Is To Convert The Problem Into A Sequence Of Steps.
- The Terms Like Algorithm Design, Programming Methodology, Data Structuring. These All Are Related To 
 Converting The Problem Into Series Of Steps Which Can Be Executed In The Computer.
 
- Problem Solving Is a Style Of Thinking Which We We Refer As Problem Decomposition.


- When We Solve a Problem , These Are The Broad Steps One Of The Guidelines Which Can Be Used In Problem 
Solving. There Are Not Hard And Fast Rule In Problem Solving. And These Steps Can Be Broken To Obtain 
Better Solution In Some Problems, But These Are The General Techniques Which Can Be Used To Obtain 
Solutions To a Large Number Of Problems.
	1. The First Step is INITIAL SOLUTION GENERATION i.e. You Have To Try And Solve The Problem Which
	Is Posed To You In Some Form. And In This Point In Initial Solution Generation , There Is Something 
	Called Inherent Solution In a Person's Mind. That Is You Must Be Able to  Solve The Problem In Your 
	Own Mind First Before You Can Really Solve It On The Computer.
	Solving Teh Problem In Own Mind Is Something Which Is Vague And Inorder To Make it More Concrete, 
	We Would Say  We Need To Decompose The Problem In Some Way.
	Decomposition Inherently Gives a Sequence Of Steps But It Gives a Very Broad Outline In That Sequence Of
	Steps.Therefore The First Thing Is INITIAL SOLUTION GENERATION.
	How To Generate Initial Solution , There Is No hard And Fast Rule, We Must Learn It Only Through 
	Experience. And Once We Got The Hang Of It , We Will Be Able To Handle  Possibly Solved Several Problem
	In Our Own Ways.
	So Getting An Initial Solution And This Initial Solution Contains a Set Of Actual Potential Programs.
	In This Step The Prime Condition That We Need To Take Care Of Is CORRECTNESS i.e The Solution Must 
	Produce Correct Result.
	The Issue Of Correctness Is Tested And Validated At This First Step.
		
	2. The Second Step Is INITIAL SOLUTION REFINEMENT i.e Given The Initial Solution We Would Like To Find
	Out Which Final Solution To Take . And To Decide That The Below Criterias Will Be Used.
		a. EFFICIENCY
				- TIME EFFICIENCY
				- SPACE EFFICIENCY
		b. ALGORITHM DESIGN		(Selection Of Exact Set Of Steps From Set Of Potential Programs)
		c. DATA STRUCTURING  	(Organization Of The Data)
	Whenever We Do a Refinement We Will Try To Maintain The Correctness Achieved In Step 1.
	And The Main Issue In Refinement Is EFFICIENCY.	
	Here We Have To Make Sure Our Program Will Run As Fast As Possible.
	 Sometimes There Will Be a Space-Time Trade-Off i.e There Will Be a Situation In Which To Reduce
	 The Space We May Have To Increase The Time And Vice Versa.
	 So Given An INITIAL SOLUTION, We Have To Choose From Set Of Potential Programs, The Final Solution.
	 And The Criteria For Choosing It Will Be EFFICIENCY.
	 
	 This Is Where The Standard Steps Which We Call Programming Methodology & Data Structuring Coming.
	 
	 
	 In Step 1 We Have To Have An Insight Into The Problem , We Have To Know Several Problem 
	 Solution Technique.And In Combination Of These Things With Our Own Intelligence And Experience 
	 Will be Able To Get The Initial Solution. Here In This Steps 2 Different People Can Generate 
	 2 Different Solution For The Same Problem. But Once The Initial Solution Is Ready, Now In Step 2 There
	 Are Some Methodology Which Are Quite Standard And Well Known, And These Form Part Of Programming 
	 Methodology & Data Structures. 
	 
	 3. FINAL SOLUTION.
	 
	Now After The Step 3. The Programming Comes Into Picture. Given The Final Solution Defined In Some
	Steps In Our Own Natural Language. Some People Call It As Pseudo Code, Some Refer It As Flow Chart.
	Now We Have To Write a Program , And When We Come To Write s Program, We Take Help Of a 
	VEHICLE LANGUAGE(C,C++,JAVA,C#).
	
	So People In Computer Science  Are Developing Languages Which Can Understand And Realize More
	And More Structured Form Into Machine Codes. Such Language Are Referred As High Level Languages.
	These High Level Languages Require Some Features Which Makes It Quite Useful To Write Programs. And
	These Features Are Related To Data Structuring ,Algorithm Design And Specially Problem Decomposition.
