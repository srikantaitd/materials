Working With GIT Version Control Tool:
=====================================
git clone <project-url>
git status
git add <file-name>
git push -m <message>
git branch
git push origin <remote-repository-name(dev/master)>
git pull origin <remote-repository-name(dev/master)>

Creating new branch for devlopment and commit the code:
-------------------------------------------------------
1. git checkout -b <branch-name>  -> Creates a Branch
2. git checkout <branch-name>     -> Switch to New Branch
3. git push origin  <branch_name>  -> commits the new branch to remote repository

Creatng Pull Request to Merge the Code with Master Branch
Once the review is done, then merge the code with master branch

Getting the latest Code From master branch which was Pushed By Some Other Team Memers:
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Swith to master branch from local branch first by using below command:	
	git checkout master

2. Do a git pull on the master branch as below:
	git pull origin master

3. Switch the the local branch as below:
	git checkout <local_branchname(dev)>

4. Do a git pull on the local branch as below:
	git pull origin <local_branchname(dev)>
   This Command in Step4 will Bring the Latest Code From the master Branch into The Local Branch.
   
Conflicts Resolution:
---------------------
After more than 1 developer did change to the same file in same line code, Conflicts will come.

1.In the local branch run the command as below:
	git pull origin <remote-repo-name(master)>

2. git stash or (git add  and git comit )  to save the local changes temporarily as below:
      git stash

3. git pull origin master  
      This Command will bring the Remote Changes Into Local.

4. git stash apply
      To Merge the Previously Localy Saved Changes With the Remote Changes.

   Now Conflict Message will be Highlited. And this Needs To be Manually Resolved. 

5. Add the Newly Merger File into Remote as Usual as Below:
	git add <file-name>
	git commit -m "merge conficts resolved"
	git pull origin  <remote_repo_name>
